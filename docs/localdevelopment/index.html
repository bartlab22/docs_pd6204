The source repository that your fork is copied from is known as the &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; repository and you will need to update the local git configuration with the upstream repository url to keep your local copy in sync.</li></ul></li><li>Step 4: Create a branch to hold your proposed changes<ul><li>Creating a branch makes a copy of the changes you are proposing to the repository, which enables a reviewer to see exactly the changes you are proposing when they review your request. If approved the branch will be merged and the changes you proposed will be made, at which point the branch can be deleted as in this use case, the branch is only used to story a copy of a proposed change until it is approved or rejected.</li></ul></li><li>Step 5: Make and commit any changes needed<ul><li>You should always make smaller changes and submit your updates to GitHub frequently, which helps to prevent merge conflicts that occur when different people make updates without having the latest version of the file.</li></ul></li><li>Step 6: Push the new branch you created for your updates to your forked repo on GitHub.<ul><li>Pushing your updates to your fork on GitHub provides a place to store your recommended edits for them to be reviewed before they are merged.</li></ul></li><li>Step 7: Create Pull Request<ul><li>Using the GitHub website, you can easily submit a pull request to the upstream repository setting the new branch you created for your updates as the source and the upstream repository as the destination.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=walkthrough-of-the-local-development-process>Walkthrough of the local development process</h2><p>This exercise is designed for you to follow along and execute each step as instructed below to allow you to go through the entire process in this learning environment before you need to work on an actual production change.</p><h3 id=step-1-forking-the-upstream-repository>Step 1: Forking the upstream repository</h3><ul><li><strong>Action:</strong><ul><li>Open a browser to <a href=https://github.com>https://github.com</a> and login</li><li>Navigate to the ModernApps Learning Docs site at <a href=https://github.com/ModernAppsNinja/docs_pd6204>https://github.com/ModernAppsNinja/docs_pd6204</a></li><li>On the upper right hand corner of the browser, click the <code>Fork</code> button</li></ul></li></ul><p><details><summary><em>Click to expand screenshot for this action</em></summary>

This document focuses on the most common use case for git branches, which is making a temporary branch you can use to submit edits and updates you make to files in a repository. Please keep in mind the best practices shared in this document are specific to this use case and may not be the same for different use cases.</li></ul><p>When making edits and updates to a git repository, you always need to be careful to minimize the chances of a &ldquo;merge conflict&rdquo; which occurs when two people make edits to the same file at the same time and git is not sure how to combine the different edits into the desired final document. Occasional merge conflicts are normal in git repositories and are not difficult to resolve, but they do require manual intervention and can really slow down the agility of your project.</p><p>Fortunately, by following some basic best practices when you make updates, it greatly reduces the chances of running into merge conflicts to the point where conflicts can be pretty rare when managed well.</p><p>The main principle you should keep in mind when updating files on a repository is that you should try to make small changes and then commit and sync your updates with the upstream repository frequently. If you have several changes you need to make, its best to break them into several smaller changes to stay closely in sync with the repo.</p><p>Git provides several tools you can use to help ensure that git&rsquo;s version control process works smoothly, including features like branches and commits. When you create a branch, git creates a logical space to keep files you modify seperate from files you have not modified in your fork of the repository.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> Your branch name does need to be unique in your fork, so it is important to check what branches exist before creating one, deleting old branches after they are merged or closed, and I also append a random or semi-random number to temporary branch as an extra precaution to make sure I dont accidentally reuse an old branch that may still be waiting to merge or forgot to delete. One other consideration is that while branches are local to your fork, there may be times where you are working on a common fork with other people, so it is a good habit to include your username or something unique to you.</p><ul><li><strong>Action:</strong> From your shell command prompt, ensure your prompt is set to the directory for your forked repository and enter the following commands - be careful to replace &ldquo;YOURGITHUBUSERNAME&rdquo; with your gitub username:</li></ul><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#8f5902;font-style:italic># Enter the &#34;git branch&#34; command to review the names of current branches</span>

Since you just did the fetch/rebase, you can now proceed to make updates to the local copy of your fork.</p><p>In this step you will create a new file so you can practice uploading and submitting an update to the upstream repository, but first update VSCode with a plugin that allows you to cut and paste images, as uploading images is one key action that is often easier to do from your local workstation than through the browser.</p><h5 id=using-vscode-to-cut-and-paste-images>Using VSCode to cut and paste images</h5><p>When you put an image in a markdown or html document, you include a link to the image in the document and the image file itself is saved either in some folder in the repository or online somewhere in an accessible location. So to put an image in a document is actually a 3 step process: 1) Upload the image somewhere. 2) Determine what the address will be of the image once its published. 3) Put the permanent link to the image in the document where you want it to display.</p><p>When you are working with or creating documents that have multiple images, it can be very cumbersome if you do not have a tool that helps making image uploads easier.</p><p>VSCode has multiple different extensions that can be used to enable cutting and pasting of images. These extensions generally work in one of 2 ways:</p><ol><li>Some cut/paste extensions work by uploading your file to an online image or file hosting service and then include a link to the url for the image in the document. This approach has the advantage that the location you paste the image to is always the same and does not need to be adjusted to save the file in a particular folder in a repo, which can be a different location on different repositories. The downside of this approach is users need to get an API key for the online image service they want to use, and then if a repository wants to keep all images in a common account, a mechanism needs to exist to share a common API key among users or setup RBAC to allow different users to share access.</li><li>The main method that extensions use to cut/paste images is to paste the image in some folder in the repository where the document you want the image to appear in is located. This method has the advantage that the source image is easy to find and update if needed, and ensures the contents of the repository are free from external dependencies and there is no risk of an external image source being offline or removed. It also uses the same IAM and RBAC policies used for the repo itself. The downside of this method is that you will need to adjust the settings for the copy/paste extension for the repository you are editing, as different repositories often have different locations where images should be stored.</li></ol><p>In this document and for all content posted to repositories in the ModernApps Learning GitHub organization, at the current time we strongly prefer using an extension that implements the second method as it ensures that all images are available within the repository and not associated with an individuals personal fileshare or other external services where we cannot assure ongoing availability of the content.</p><p>There are several extensions that use this second method, and it doesnt matter which of the available extensions you use so long as it saves the image file locally within the target repository. I will recommend and use a specific extension in these instructions, but I have found that different extensions work better with different operating systems, so if you have any problems with the image cut/paste extension used in these instructions, you can search the VSCode extension directory and try an alternative extension. Also note that the act of taking a screen capture may not work well out-of-the-box with many linux distributions, so I use the <a href=https://shutter-project.org/>Shutter screenshot tool</a> on Linux to take screen captures which is not required but may be useful if you have any challenges making screen captures.</p><ul><li><strong>Action:</strong> Open VSCode and navigate to the <code>Extensions</code> sidebar. In the search box enter &ldquo;paste image to markdown&rdquo; and then scroll through the results until you see &ldquo;Paste Image to Markdown&rdquo; from the developer &ldquo;Liu-Yong&rdquo;</li></ul><p><details><summary><em>Click to expand screenshot for this action</em></summary>

<img src=/docs_pd6204/docs/localdevelopment/2021-05-19-22-37-16.png alt></details></p><p><strong>Important:</strong> Different GitHub organizations and repositories have different standards for where images should be stored. The settings provided below will work for this example, however when you use the paste image extension to make updates outside of this example, it is important that you adjust the <code>Path</code> setting to save the image to the appropriate location for the repository you are updating, and update the <code>Insert Pattern</code> setting so that the image link pasted into the document accurately links to the location where the save image will be served. Within the ModernApps Learning GitHub Organization, we are working on having a consistent standard for how images are saved across all repositories, however this is still a work in progress, so it is important to look at the repo you want to update to determine where image files are stored for that repo.</p><ul><li><strong>Action:</strong> Update the paste image settings to match the following values. Leave any values not listed here set to their defaults:<ul><li><strong>Field Name:</strong> <code>Paste Image to Markdown: Base Path</code><ul><li><strong>Field Value:</strong> This field should be completely blank with no text.</li><li><strong>Explanation:</strong> By default this field populates variables intended to dynamically reflect an accurate path in the <code>Insert Pattern</code> field, but I have had a difficult time getting it to work consistently so I leave it blank and instead insert a static path into the <code>Insert Pattern</code> field as shown below.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Field Name:</strong> <code>Paste Image to Markdown: Insert Pattern</code><ul><li><strong>Important:</strong> In the following field value, <strong>replace the string &ldquo;YOURLOWERCASEGITHUBUSERNAME&rdquo; with your github username in all lower case letters</strong></li><li><strong>Field Value:</strong> <span style=background-color:#f5f5f5><nobr>${imageSyntaxPrefix}/docs_pd6204/docs/localdevelopment/guestbook/YOURLOWERCASEGITHUBUSERNAME/${imageFileName}${imageSyntaxSuffix}</nobr></span></li><li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This field provides the pasted link in the document to where the image will be served, but does not define the location where the image will be saved. The imageSyntaxPrefix and suffix insert the required formatting to display images in markdown. The &ldquo;/docs_pd6204/docs/localdevelopment/guestbook/&rdquo; is the URL path to directory the image will be served from, and the imageFilename is a variable that will insert the dynamically generated name of the image file that gets created when you paste the image in the document. In the following steps in this example, you will be creating a document that will be saved as the only document in a folder, and the image will be saved within the same directory as the document. With this method where images are saved in the same folder as the document, you will need to update this setting every time you edit a different document to ensure the pasted image link accurately reflects where the image is stored. A key advantage of this method is that it keeps the images used in a document associated with that document, making the document portable and free from complicated dependencies such as dedicated image directories where it can be very difficult to tell which image is associated with which document.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Field Name:</strong> <code>Paste Image to Markdown: Name Prefix</code><ul><li><strong>Field Value:</strong> <code>/</code></li></ul></li><li><strong>Field Name:</strong> <code>Paste Image to Markdown: Path</code><ul><li><strong>Field Value:</strong> <code>${currentFileDir}</code></li><li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This field defines where the image will be saved in your local directory. When the <code>currentFileDir</code> variable is set as the <code>Path</code> value, the extension will save the image into the same directory as the document you are pasting the image into. If you need to save images in a different folder, update this field with the path to the folder where you want pasted images to be saved.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5 id=create-a-document-to-upload-to-the-guestbook-directory>Create a document to upload to the guestbook directory</h5><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You can customize the text you put in this file, but be careful to only submit text or images that are business professional and do not include anything that is potentially offensive.

If you did not see a link to the image get pasted in your document, or if you do not see the image file being saved to its target location in your directory, please review the following list for resolutions to common problems.</p><ul><li><strong>Possible Issue:</strong> The keyboard shortcut used in this example might not work the same on your system<ul><li><strong>Solution</strong> Place your mouse cursor at the location in the document where you want to paste the image link. Access the command palette for your VSCode environment, which by default can be opened with the keyboard shortcut <code>ctrl + shift + p</code>. At the command palette prompt, type <code>Paste Image to Markdown</code>, which should bring up a command link that will paste them image when you click it. If there is an issue, a relevant error message may be displayed briefly in a popup window on the lower right hand corner of your monitor.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Possible Issue:</strong> There is a problem with your workstations' copy/paste/clipboard functions for images and/or there is no image on the clipboard<ul><li><strong>Solution</strong> Confirm that you can copy and paste images successfully by opening an application that you know supports pasting images, such as a word processing app like libreoffice or another app you know supports standard pasting of images, and attempt to paste an image. If you are unable to paste an image in the other application, it indicates there is a problem with the ability to copy and paste images on your system and is not related to this guide. I would recommend you look for support directly related to your operating system and workstation, and once you are able to get standard copy/paste functionality for images working on your system, resume this lab.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Possible Issue:</strong> The link to the image was pasted in the document, but you do not see the image file itself. It is possible the image file was saved in different directory than you were expecting and so you do not see it, caused by a misconfiguration of the <code>Paste Image to Markdown: Path</code> setting.<ul><li><strong>Solution</strong> In the VSCode file browser, right click the local directory for your fork, select <code>Find in Folder</code>, and search for the filename of the image you can find in the link that was pasted into the document. If you find the image in a different location than you expected, adjust the <code>Paste Image to Markdown: Path</code> setting until the issue is corrected.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Possible Issue:</strong> The image was saved as expected in your directory, but the link that was pasted in the document does not seem to match the location of the image<ul><li><strong>Solution</strong> Proceed to the next section in this step where you can validate the image link by doing a local hugo build. Keep in mind that the location where the image is saved is not the same as the location where the image will be served from. The <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo static site generator</a> will copy the image to a different location to be served on the generated modernapps.ninja/GitHub Pages website for the repo, so the saved image path and the link to the image in the document should not match exactly. If there is a different problem with the pasted link to the image in the document, adjust the <code>Paste Image to Markdown: Insert Pattern</code> setting until the issue is corrected.</details></li></ul></li></ul><h5 id=validate-your-updates-prior-to-committing>Validate your updates prior to committing</h5><p>Most updates made to ModernApps Learning repositories are related to content that is created in markdown files which are used to automatically generate html files to present a standard webpage that is served by <a href=https://pages.github.com/>GitHub Pages</a> in the <a href=https://modernapps.ninja>https://modernapps.ninja</a> domain. If your desired updates are to a repository that serves a webpage, you wont be able to tell how the webpage will appear until your submitted updates are approved and Hugo builds updated versions of the webpages. When updates are merged into ModernApps Learning repositories, and automated workflow triggers hugo to build and post updated webpages that reflect the changes you made. It is usually desirable for you to be able to confirm how your updates will appear when rendered in html before you commit and submit updates to GitHub.</p><p>If you have installed hugo in your local shell, it is very easy to have hugo serve the rendered webpages in a special development mode where every time you save changes to a file, hugo automatically generates and serves updated webpages locally on your workstation.</p><ul><li><strong>Action:</strong> In VSCode, ensure that a terminal is open.
